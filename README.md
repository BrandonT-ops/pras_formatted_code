Here's a program meant to control the "PRAS central" and accessories connected to it

Well, the code is divided into components and other classes

Each has specific functions and all work in symbiosis to control the home

Automatisms is a class meant to handle all automations at home

Central is to work as CPU

Components represent the various appliances connected and their properties

Data_manager is meant to control all data circulation(JSON and Files)

GSM Module just contains a bunch of functions meant for the GSM

Web controller is meant to handle all affaires coming from the web server

Main is where the magic and interaction betweeen all classes sub classes operate
